* \Assignment 5: Create a menu for customers
Overview:
In Unit 4, you continued to develop your course portfolio by examining the management of sample inventory or service hours provided. This scenario will be expanded upon in this unit as you begin to develop a robust menu-driven program that will provide more product or service details for the customer.

Your company is looking to create a menu-driven program that provides the customer with the ability to select products or services from a list of choices and input the desired quantities. The menu choices and quantities will then determine necessary calculations and recommended purchase options. The results will then be displayed as output so the customer can make a decision on whether to proceed with the purchase or terminate the program.

Therefore, in this assignment, you will create a program that will assist you in providing a customer with the most accurate feedback regarding a product or service in order to determine a business transaction.



Specification:
For this assignment, you will write a Java program that makes selections based on user input. The user MUST be able to select TWO items from the menu provided. You will need to test and output the results of your source code. For example, your output will display the input value for quantity, products or services selected, associated costs, and a final summary of the user’s selection.

The initial output to be displayed will be:

The company logo you created in an earlier unit
A welcome message
A menu that displays at least 4 different products or service packages your company offers along with each item’s respective cost per unit. An example is provided below:
Video Games - $5.00 (per unit)
Data Analytics - $8.00 (per unit)
Anti-Virus - $6.00 (per unit)
Financial Software - $10.00 (per unit)
The inputs required for creating this Java program are listed below:

A prompt asking the user to make their first product or service package selection from the provided menu (for example, “Please make your first selection from the options provided in the product/service menu:”)
A prompt for the product quantity or number of hours of service requested for the first item selected.
A prompt asking the user to select their second menu selection
A prompt for the product quantity or number of hours of service requested for the second item selected.
The calculations and decisions required are:

Calculate the initial cost of each product/service requested.
Identify if the first and second menu items have been selected, If so, calculate and apply a multi-product/service discount of 10%. Otherwise, no discount is applied.
Identify if the user has requested more than 10 units or service hours for both menu selections. If so, a 5% discount will be applied. Otherwise, no discount is applied.
Calculate the total cost including any applied discount.
The outputs required are:

The choices selected by the user
The quantities selected by the user
A summary of the total cost for each product or service selected (clearly demonstrating whether a 10%, 5% or both discounts have been applied).
A prompt asking the user whether they wish to proceed with the transaction or terminate the program. For example, "Choose 1 to complete your purchase, or 2 to exit."
A final message (i.e., “Congratulations! Your purchase has been processed” or “I am sorry we could not provide you with any products today. Please check back when you are ready to purchase.”)
Be mindful of testing and debugging procedures, and best practices learned in order to ensure proper output prior to submitting your code. Use comments to describe the purpose of your code revisions and additions.

Submit the source code (the .java file) for your program and a screen shot of the program output in a zip file named as follows: Assignment5 followed by an underscore (_), followed by your first name initial, followed by your last name, followed by your CTYOnline student ID. For example, if your name is Jane Smith and your student ID is 999999, your zip file would be Assignment5_jsmith999999.zip.
