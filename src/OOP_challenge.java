/*
    Class abstraction and encapsulation are vital components of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). For this discussion, create a UML diagram that depicts an Abstract and Concrete class(es) for employees. However, be cognizant of specific types of employees. For instance, there are hourly, salaried, and exempt employees. These employees would all be considered subclasses of the Employee class. A few possible employee attributes would be hourly pay, overtime pay, weekly rate, and monthly rate. There are many others that can be considered but you should be able to identify a few from conducting some research.

        You must be able to demonstrate and discuss the UML relationship between these classes in your text response (3-5 sentences). Please post your diagram in the forum as a PDF or image file.
