    As your company grows and adds more people, you’re going to need some software to help run and
        manage the business. There are lots of business functions now, and different people performing them
        at different times.
        The company management has asked you to create a menu system that sketches out functionality for
        your business management system. The menu system will organize the business tasks to make it easier
        and more efficient for the employees to do their jobs.
        The system you create is designed to eventually perform 2 high level, or main actions: inventory actions
        and sales actions.
        Each of the high-level actions have sub actions, too. For inventory management, you’ll need tasks for
        adding products to the system and viewing inventory items and quantities.
        Employees who work in sales will need to be able to view product information and assist customers who
        are purchasing products on their sub-menu.
        The menu system you design and code in Java will help your business be more organized as it grows. Are
        you ready for the challenge?!*/
