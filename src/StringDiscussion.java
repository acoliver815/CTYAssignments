/*
    The StringBuilder and StringBuffer classes can be used to replace the String class. For this discussion, create a short program that asks the user to enter a String object. After entering the String object, the user will be asked whether they wish to add, insert, or append the String. Present the options in a menu-based format. Be sure to display the userâ€™s original and manipulated String as well as any important information. Please post your code in the forum as a zipped file.

        You must also post a short text response (3-5 sentences) explaining the advantages/disadvantages of the StringBuilder/StringBuffer classes.
