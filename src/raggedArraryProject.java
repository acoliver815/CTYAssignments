/* Arrays challenge
In a two-dimensional array, each row is considered to be an array. Therefore, the possibility of one row having a different length than another is quite real. When this occurs, an array is considered to be a ragged array.

For example, one row may contain 4 elements whereas the next row may contain only 3 elements.

An example is depicted below:

Int [ ] [ ] triangleArray = {

{1,2,3,4},

{1,2,3}

} ;

In this discussion topic, you will write a program that obtains the size of the first and second row of a ragged two-dimensional array. Be sure your rows do not contain the same number of elements. Please post your code in the forum as a zipped file. You must also post a short text response (3-5 sentences) explaining the advantages/disadvantages of ragged arrays.
