*  OOP 2 challenge
The concept of wrapper classes was discussed in this unit to provide you with a thorough understanding of manipulating primitive data types and converting them into objects. The benefits of wrapper classes become obvious when the need to pass objects as arguments are considered.

In this discussion, you will create a program that compares two numeric values that are entered by the user. You should be able to prompt the user with the option to enter the number of numeric value sets desired. You must be able to demonstrate full competency with the subject and be prepared to discuss the relationship between primitive data types and wrapper classes/methods in your text response (3-5 sentences).
